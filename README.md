#  Deep Learning Labs

This repository contains a series of deep learning labs completed during my university coursework. Each lab focuses on a key concept in deep learning and includes practical implementations using Python and popular frameworks..

##  Lab Overview

###  Lab 1: MLP from Scratch
- Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch.
- Focused on forward pass, backpropagation, and manual weight updates.

###  Lab 2: Batch Types, Hyperparameters, and Optimizers
- Compared **SGD**, **Mini-batch**, and **Full batch** training strategies.
- Experimented with various **hyperparameters** (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
- Tested multiple **optimizers** including SGD, Adam, and RMSprop.

###  Lab 3: CNN from Scratch
- Built and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch.
- Gained understanding of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.

###  Lab 4: Transfer Learning & Segmentation
- Applied **transfer learning** using pretrained models on a COVID dataset.
- Performed **image segmentation** tasks to identify regions of interest.
